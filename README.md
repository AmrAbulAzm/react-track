# react-spark-scroll

React port of [spark-scroll](https://github.com/gilbox/spark-scroll/). 

# install

    npm install react-spark-scroll

# [demo](http://gilbox.github.io/react-spark-scroll/examples/demo/demo.html)

Documentation still needs to be updated, in the meantime checkout the
[demo](http://gilbox.github.io/react-spark-scroll/examples/demo/demo.html)
and the [source code](https://github.com/gilbox/react-spark-scroll/blob/master/examples/demo/app.js).
It's so declarative you might not even need documentation ;-)

# status

### Completed:

- Keyframe animations w/Rekapi
- Formulas

- onScroll `callback` prop (previously in angular was `spark-scroll-callback` attribute)
- Custom formulas, actionProps
- sparkSetup
- `SparkProxy` (in angular called `sparkTrigger`)
- publish to npm
- Demo
- Invalidation
    * Manual invalidation mechanism
    * Invalidation interval
    * Automatic invalidation on window resize

### Todo:

- Test on various browsers
- Re-parsing of data when changed
- README
- Support for GSAP

### Probably Won't do:

- [spark-scroll-ease](https://github.com/gilbox/spark-scroll/blob/master/src/spark-scroll.coffee#L213)
  attribute (Not really liking this feature)
